SPEED â€“ SPectral Elements in Elastodynamics with Discontinuous Galerkin

### What is this repository for? ###

SPEED is an open-source code designed with the aim of simulating large-scale seismic events in three-dimensional complex media: from far-field to near-field including soil-structure interaction effects.
SPEED combines the flexibility of discontinuous Galerkin methods to connect together, through a domain decomposition paradigm, Spectral Element blocks where high-order polynomials are used. SPEED heavily exploits parallelism in the framework of explicit time integration and features optimal scalability properties making use of the open-source libraries METIS and MPI for mesh partitioning and message passing.
SPEED is jointly developed at Politecnico di Milano by The Laboratory for Modeling and Scientific Computing MOX of the Department of Mathematics and by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
